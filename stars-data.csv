Vision & Mission
The LoveLife Foundation is an Oakland-based community building organization committed to promoting life and saving lives through community revitalization, leadership and development. The mission of the LoveLife Foundation is to provide a supportive and empowering environment for at-risk youth, and to mobilize community support to change economic and social conditions that lead to violence. We aim to help youth discover positive and life-affirming alternatives to the destructive influences of drugs, gangs, and the dangers of life on the streets. To accomplish this, we help each youth build a positive future with educational and vocational programs, focusing on multimedia and technological training and career development services.

Promoting Life
We assist youth in producing award winning television public service announcements and radio programs that speak out against violence and affirm life. Too many children have senselessly lost their lives. We are all responsible for the children.
